Pull requests and issues are always welcome! Still, the code should follow
some quality rules in order to be merged.

Coding style
------------

* Please follow PEP8 and PEP257 rules.
* Please don't repeat the code if it is unnecessary.
* Please cover the code with tests.

Submitting issues
-----------------

In case of bugs please create a comprehensive description. For example, if
there is a bug in ``add_record`` method, please include the dictionary/xml
passed and a snippet of the code. Don't include the secrets and passwords in
the content!

In case of a suggestion for a new feature, please show an example. A test
case (in spirit of the TDD) would be perfect, but is not required.
